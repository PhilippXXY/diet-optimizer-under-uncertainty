# Diet Optimizer Under Uncertainty

This project aims to optimize dietary plans under uncertainty using mathematical modeling and optimization techniques. It leverages GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) for implementing the optimization models and LaTeX for documenting the theoretical background and interpreting the results.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/`: Contains the GAMS source files for different tasks.
- `results/`: Contains the output files generated by GAMS.
- `task/`: Contains files for documenting the solutions and their correspondings tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/download/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PhilippXXY/diet-optimizer-under-uncertainty.git
    cd diet-optimizer-under-uncertainty
    ```

2. Run the GAMS models:
    ```sh
    gams src/r1/Aufgabe1.gms
    gams src/r3/Aufgabe3a.gms
    gams src/r3/Aufgabe3b.gms
    ```
