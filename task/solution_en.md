    - The source code can be found in [Aufgabe3a.gms](../src/r3/Aufgabe3a.gms).
  - **(ii)**
    - The corresponding execution can be viewed under [Aufgabe3a.gms](../src/r3/Aufgabe3a.gms). From this, it can be seen that after introducing the uncertainties the optimal value of the robust counterpart is `7.914778 â‚¬` and the optimal point is located at `(Cornflakes, Carrots, Potatoes, Milk, Chocolate, Steak) = (3, 4, 4.7749, 1.0713, 1.9635, 1)`. The remaining, unmentioned foods are not consumed.
